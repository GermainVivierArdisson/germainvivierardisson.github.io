Welcome to my personal website !

I am a first year PhD student, under the supervision of [Axel Parmentier](https://axelparmentier.github.io/) ([CERMICS](https://cermics-lab.enpc.fr/), Ecole des Ponts) and [Mathieu Blondel](https://mblondel.org/) (Google DeepMind).

Before that, I graduated from [Ecole polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/) (X2020) and got a master's degree from Sorbonne Universit√© in Learning and Algorithms ([Master M2A](https://m2a.lip6.fr/)).
